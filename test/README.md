# 🧪 Test Suite Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the Taiga MCP Server.

## 📋 Test Scripts Overview

### Quick Commands
```bash
npm test              # Run unit + quick tests (recommended for development)
npm run test:unit     # Run unit tests only
npm run test:quick    # Run quick functionality tests only
```

### Advanced Testing
```bash
npm run test:basic       # Full MCP protocol tests (requires server startup)
npm run test:integration # Real Taiga API tests (requires credentials)
npm run test:full       # Run all test suites
```

## 📁 Test Files

**What it tests:**
- MCP server creation
- Tool registration process
- Environment variable detection
- Basic server configuration

### 🔌 `mcpTest.js` - MCP Protocol Tests
- Tests full MCP client-server communication

- **Complex setup** - requires child process
- ⚠️  May have connectivity issues in some environments

**What it tests:**
- MCP transport connectivity
- Tool listing and invocation
- Resource reading
- Error handling
- Parameter validation

### 🌐 `integration.js` - Taiga API Integration Tests
- Tests real Taiga API connectivity
- Validates end-to-end workflows
- **Requires credentials** in `.env` file
- **Network dependent**

**What it tests:**
- Authentication with Taiga
- Real project listing
- API endpoint responses
- Resource reading with live data

### 🏃 `runTests.js` - Test Runner
- Orchestrates all test suites
- Provides comprehensive reporting
- Handles test isolation and cleanup

## 🎯 Recommended Testing Strategy

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Quick validation during development
npm test

# Before committing changes
npm run test:unit
npm run test:quick

# Full validation (when you have time)
npm run test:full
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Minimal CI tests (no credentials needed)
npm run test:unit
npm run test:quick

# Full CI tests (with Taiga credentials)
npm run test:integration
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Constants | ✅ | ✅ |
| Utilities | ✅ | ✅ |
| TaigaService | ✅ | ✅ |
| MCP Tools | ✅ | ✅ |
| Authentication | ❌ | ✅ |
| API Endpoints | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🔧 Test Environment Setup

### For Basic Tests (npm test)
No setup required - works out of the box.

### For Integration Tests
Create `.env` file:
```env
TAIGA_API_URL=https://api.taiga.io/api/v1
TAIGA_USERNAME=your_username
TAIGA_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### For MCP Protocol Tests
Ensure Node.js child process spawning works:
- Unix/Linux: Should work by default
- Windows: May require additional configuration

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Connection timeout" errors
- This is common with MCP protocol tests
- Use `npm run test:unit` for reliable testing
- The issue is with test environment, not the actual MCP server

### "No credentials" warnings
- Integration tests are skipped without credentials
- This is expected and safe for CI environments

### Import/export errors
- Ensure all files use ES modules syntax
- Check file paths in test imports

## 📈 Test Results Interpretation

### Unit Tests (11 tests)
- **100% pass rate expected**
- Tests core logic without external dependencies
- Failures indicate code bugs

### Quick Tests (4 tests) 
- **100% pass rate expected**
- Tests basic MCP functionality
- Failures indicate configuration issues

### MCP Protocol Tests (8 tests)
- **May have connectivity issues**
- Transport layer complexity in test environment
- Partial failures are acceptable

### Integration Tests (Variable)
- **Depends on network and credentials**
- Skipped without credentials (OK)
- Failures may indicate API changes

## 🏆 Success Metrics

✅ **Green Build**: Unit + Quick tests pass  
🟡 **Yellow Build**: Some MCP protocol test issues  
❌ **Red Build**: Unit or Quick test failures  

The test suite provides confidence in code quality while being practical for development workflows.
